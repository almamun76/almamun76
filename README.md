I am involved in the teaching profession. I joined as a BCS (General Education) cadre officer through the 24th BCS in 2005. At present my posting is as Associate Professor (Department of Physics) in Sherpur Government College, Sherpur.

I have been fascinated with computer since my student days. Due to personal interest, I gained skills in MS Word and MS Excel that time. I had to skilled up on MS Power point for classroom teaching through digital content. I also gained expertise in graphics design and video editing. I also had to learn C and C ++ programming languages for the sake of my profession.

In 2015 I did an In-Service TOT course on C language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQLi under A2I and TQI-II projects of the Government of Bangladesh. Since then I have been very interested in working on the backend of web application. Later I worked as a Master Trainer in C language, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySqli training courses in Mymensingh TTC, Dhaka TTC, Rajshahi TTC, Sylhet TTC and Comilla TTC.

With the help of the skills acquired from that TOT course, video tutorials of different youtube channels and various tutorial websites, I developed a dynamic website for Sherpur Government College (www.sherpurgovtcollege.edu.bd) in 2017 and Sribordi Govt. College, Sherpur (www.sribordicollege.gov.bd) in 2019. Complete raw php has been used in the backend of that website. Till the 1st quarter of 2022, features like online result processing system, online admission system, online MCQ test application etc. have been added to the website.

I am currently receiving training on "Backend API development with Python" from the Study Mart online platform.

Skills: C / C++ / HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Bootstrap / JQuery / PHP / MySql / Laravel / Python / Django / MS Word / MS Excel / MS Poer Point
